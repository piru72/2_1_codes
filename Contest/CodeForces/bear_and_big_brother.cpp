// Bear Limak wants to become the largest of bears, or at least to become larger than his brother Bob.

// Right now, Limak and Bob weigh a and b respectively. It's guaranteed that Limak's weight is smaller than or equal to his brother's weight.

// Limak eats a lot and his weight is tripled after every year, while Bob's weight is doubled after every year.

// After how many full years will Limak become strictly larger (strictly heavier) than Bob?

// Input
// The only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10) — the weight of Limak and the weight of Bob respectively.

// Output
// Print one integer, denoting the integer number of years after which Limak will become strictly larger than Bob.
